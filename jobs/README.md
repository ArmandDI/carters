# Jobs Folder

Each folder here relates to a particular job with a job number and statement of work (SoW).

Copy the [`_job_folder_template`](./_job_folder_template) folder and rename with the job number and title as follows: `JXXXXX-job-title`
 - The folder name should match the branch name used for the work. 
 - Some jobs might only require modifications to existing code. In these cases, a separate job folder may not be required as a new branch will suffice until the work is completed.

When a job is completed and closed off or has not been used for a long time, the job folder can be moved to the [`archive`](./archive) folder.
 - Remember to update the job folder link in the jobs list in the client's [`README.md`](../../master/README.md#jobs) file
